##Summarize the project and what problem it was solving-
The above project is an embedded system project that was created using a code composer, using a Texas instrument cc3320s embedded board. The project outlines the basic use of a thermostat. The code utilizes a state machine that allows a user to adjust the temperature. If the temperature in the room is less than the set temperature the thermostat will turn on the red light simulating that the heat has been turned on. Once the temperature of the room reaches a set temperature the light will then turn off. The system is capable of handling wifi connectivity. 

What did you do particularly well?
Setting up the project can always be a challenge, however, I feel that setting up and testing each method is where I excelled. I enjoy debugging and testing, to ensure the code is free from bugs.
Where could you improve?
Improvements are always capable of being made, and the following constructing responses from the professor were noted. My code comments are not evident, and I lack commenting logic for better code readability. I will spend more time in this area in the future.




What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
A big skill that was learned in this project would be code readability and usability. Creating good practices such as creating good readability using code comments is an important step. 
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project readability is very good, the real state of the code is consistent, and there are no errors as far as indentations and opening and closing methods. However, The project did lack many comments on logic. The adaptability is very good, and the code can easily be changed to implement new tasks without creating logical failure due to good code cleanup in the main method.
